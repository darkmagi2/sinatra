## Synopsis

This is a basic shot counter using Sinatra as the web front end and mysql as the backend.

## Motivation

I made this as a silly way to track how many shots are owned in my circle of friends. It started as a simple HTML page and has evolved into something bigger. This project is primarily for my own education and doesn't have many reasonable applications anywhere else (yet!)

## To-Do 

There are a few things I would like to add and/or change about this project including:

~~-Make it pretty (Maybe some CSS and Javascript?)~~ Done!

-Make it more powerful (Why just increment shots when I can subtract them as well?)

-API? What if I could use API's to increment shots from other sources such as Discord?

## Contributors

Just me right now, feel free to pull and improve if you see something dumb!
